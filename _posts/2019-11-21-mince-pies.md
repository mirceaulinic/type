title: The mince pies time of the year
tags: [uk, food]

It's almost winter and my Twitter feed is full of people going nuts about mince
pies. Don't get me wrong, they're OK. But, as everything in the UK, what I see
as 'just OK', here is regarded as fabulous or outstanding.

If you are not familiar, mince pies are just sweet pies with a mixture of dried
fruits, spices and a ton of sugar. So nothing extraordinary, really. But it
probably means something for them, as it's the only sweet culinary invention -
of course, besides fish and chips, in the vast diversity of the British cuisine,
in 2000 years of history.
